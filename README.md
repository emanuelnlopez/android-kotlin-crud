# android-kotlin-crud
Small Android CRUD application written in Kotlin coded along with this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2yocpEcE_g

The intent was to practice some `Kotlin` and to get to know some Android libraries and features like `Room`, `LiveData`, `DataBinding`, `Coroutines` and `ViewModel`.

Here's a small video showcasing the app features: [android-kotlin-crud.mp4](/extras/android-kotlin-crud.mp4)
